# Shopify X Keychron K3 Pro
Shopify x Keychron K3 Pro ANSI layout JSON with lock key Macro

Originally sourced from: https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware/blob/bluetooth_playground/keyboards/keychron/k3_pro/via_json/k3_pro_ansi_rgb.json

This is the only JSON file that loaded the keyboard in the https://usevia.app/design in order to remap the keys. No need to use V2. This is automatically V3 detected.

In order to use the lock key, top right, instead of the RGB Mode+, remap using a Macro. M0: {KC_LCTL,KC_LGUI,KC_Q}
